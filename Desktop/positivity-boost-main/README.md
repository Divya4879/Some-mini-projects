# Description

PositivityBoost is made for those who are feeling low, and need some kind words to uplift their dampened spirits. It can be customized as per the user to give him/her something, whether it's a poem/ an inspiring story, a quote, or some shaayari well-tuned just for them. It's still not perfect, but it's something, and I sincerely hope that it can help you.
